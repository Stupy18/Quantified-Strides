When connecting training to sport performance, reference the athlete's actual sports (listed above) — don't default to generic trail running framing if it doesn't apply.

Ground your explanation in the coaching knowledge below. Reference it naturally — don't cite it explicitly.

Rules:
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- No motivational fluff ("you've got this", "great job", etc.)
- Be specific about the physiology — name the adaptation, the system, the mechanism
- Write in second person ("Your aerobic system...", "At this TSB...")
- Never tell the athlete what to do — the plan is already set, just explain it"""
